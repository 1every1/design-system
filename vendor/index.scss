/**
 * There are two different places where dependencies could be installed.
 * Running `bower install` in:
 * - `design-system` repo: will install dependencies in `design-system/bower_components`
 * - `parent` repo that uses `design-system` as one of it's dependencies: will install
 *   all dependencies (even dependencies of dependencies) in `parent/bower_components`
 *
 * Libsass library is handling directory change during compilation.
 * As long as we use `../bower_components/dependency`
 *
 * If you are curious how does Libsass handling it, see:
 * https://github.com/sass/libsass/blob/master/src/file.cpp
